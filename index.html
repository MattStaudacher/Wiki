                    Wonder Stories was an early American science fiction
                    magazine published under several titles from 1929 to
                    1955. It was founded by Hugo Gernsback after he lost
                    control of his first science fiction magazine, Amazing
                    Stories. In 1936 he sold Wonder Stories to Ned Pines at
                    Beacon Publications; retitled Thrilling Wonder Stories,
                    it continued for nearly 20 years. The editors under
                    Gernsback's ownership were David Lasser, who worked
                    hard to improve the quality of the fiction, and later
                    Charles Hornig. They published some well-received
                    fiction, such as Stanley G. Weinbaum's "A Martian
                    Odyssey", but were overshadowed by the success of their
                    chief competitor Astounding Stories. For a period in the
                    early 1940s the magazine was aimed at younger readers,
                    with a juvenile editorial tone and covers that depicted
                    beautiful women in implausibly revealing spacesuits. By
                    the end of the 1940s, in the opinion of science fiction
                    historian Mike Ashley, the magazine briefly rivaled
                    Astounding. (Full article...)
